    <h2 id="personalHeader1">About Me</h2>
    
    <p>Hey there! I'm Ivan Valdes, a current senior at UNF studying Information Science, with a side of Marketing. I started off thinking about a business degree, but found it didn't grab me enough on its own. That's when I realized I had a knack for computing and problem-solving, which made Information Science seem like the perfect blend of both my interests.</p>

    <p>I'm a South Florida guy, originally from a town called Southwest Ranches. It was a pretty peaceful place to grow up, not a lot of neighbors, but it meant I learned how to keep myself entertained. This involved a lot of outdoor adventures like "hunting" lizards or just being out in nature. I played a ton of sports in high school - Ice Hockey, American Football - you name it. If it involved a bit of rough and tumble, I was there. I also got pretty far with martial arts, almost made it to black belt before college got in the way. And if you look closely, you might spot the gunshot scar on my arm from an accident in high school - pretty wild, right?</p>

    <h2 id="personalHeader2">Hobbies & Interests</h2>

    <p>When it comes to downtime, I love being outdoors, going for walks and hikes, especially when my girlfriend's with me. We have this fun little hobby of looking out for cool mushrooms like <a class="index" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hericium_erinaceus" target="_blank">lions mane</a> or <a class="index" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingzhi_(mushroom)" target="_blank">reishi</a> mushrooms. When I'm indoors, you'll usually find me gaming. I'm actually pretty good at an FPS called <a class="index" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_Siege" target="_blank" >Rainbow 6 Siege</a>, was even ranked #72 worldwide once. I used to do <a class="index" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motocross" target="_blank">motocross</a> but since moving to Jacksonville I had to sell my bike because I used to just ride around my neighborhood and up here its not as simple as that. On the nerdier side, I love getting absorbed into new programming languages and practices. And this semester, I'm pretty pumped to dive into a big senior project where I'll be working on asp.net and helping out our community.</p>

    <h2 id="personalHeader3">Education</h2>
    <p>In my early school days, I was at an elementary school called Manatee Bay. I lost a lot of friends moving to middle school due to zoning changes, which wasn't fun. Middle school was Silver Trail for me, where I played the saxophone in the band.</p>
    <p>High school had its highs and lows. I loved playing football for the school, but injuries often got in the way. Now, I'm at UNF, hoping to wrap up my degree in a year's time.</p>
