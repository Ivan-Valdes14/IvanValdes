				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="gitHubStuff/images/Headshot.jpg" alt="IvanValdes" class="profile-pic">
				<p>Hey there! I'm Ivan Valdes, a current senior at UNF studying Information Science, with a Minor in Digital Marketing. I started off thinking about a business degree, but found it didn't grab my attention enough on its own. That's when I realized I had a knack for computing and problem-solving, which made Information Science the perfect blend for both my interests.</p>

    				<p>I'm a South Florida guy, originally from a town called Southwest Ranches. It was a peaceful place to grow up, not a lot of neighbors, which meant I had to keep myself entertained. This involved a lot of outdoor adventures like "hunting" lizards or just being out in nature. I played a lot of sports in high school - Ice Hockey, American Football - you name it. If it involved a bit of roughness and teamwork, I was there. I was really persistent with martial arts, and almost made it to black belt before college got in the way. If you look closely, you might spot the gunshot scar on my arm from an accident in high school - pretty wild, right?</p>
				<p>When it comes to downtime, I love being outdoors, going for walks and hikes, especially when my girlfriend's with me. We have this fun little hobby of looking out for cool mushrooms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hericium_erinaceus" target="_blank">lions mane</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingzhi_(mushroom)" target="_blank">reishi</a> mushrooms. When I'm indoors, you'll usually find me gaming. I'm actually pretty good at an FPS called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_Siege" target="_blank" >Rainbow 6 Siege</a>, and was even ranked #72 worldwide once. I used to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motocross" target="_blank">motocross</a>, but since moving to Jacksonville I had to sell my bike. On the nerdier side, I love getting absorbed into new programming languages and practices. I'm pretty excited to dive into my Intro to Computer Security Class!</p>

					<h3>Senior Project</h3>
					<p>The following item is a link to the GitHub repo for my portion of the senior project so you can see how all my code was implemented throughout the project. The project was done for Florida Mission of Mercy, a non-profit organization that serves the less fortunate and provides free dental care.</p>

					<h3>Data Analytics Senior Project</h3>
					<p>The following link is to my Senior Data Analytics Project. We conducted tests on whether the suicide rate increased due to certain independent variables; the results were quite surprising.</p>
